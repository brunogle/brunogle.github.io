title: A Prime-Generating Constant
tags: posts
description: |
  We present a constant and a recursive relation to define a sequence fn such that
  the floor of fn is the nth prime. Therefore, this constant generates the complete sequence
  of primes. We also show this constant is irrational and consider other sequences that can be
  generated using the same method

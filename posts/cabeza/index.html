        Game of Cabeza and an Engine</h2>
    

<div class="container">

<h1>Rules</h1>

<p>
Cabeza is a two player strategy game played on a 10x10 board. Each player has 5 different pieces in the game at all times.
Except for the cabeza, the rest of the pieces consist of integer-sided rectangular prisms which are always aligned to the board grid 
(called block pieces).
</p>

<br>

<p>
Players (<span style="color:red;">red</span> and <span style="color:rgb(23, 87, 207);">blue</span>) take turns, starting with red. In each turn a player has to choose a single piece and move
it once or twice according to valid move patterns. All block pieces move by rotating along one of its edges that touch the
grid, effectivly "rolling" from one position to another.
</p>

<br>

<p>
All pieces can be rotated once or twice per turn, except for the Opa (2x2x2) piece which can only be rolled once.
</p>

<br>

<p>Specifically, the block pieces are named:</p>

<br>


<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <li>Mini 1 × 1 × 1</li>
  <li>Flaco 2 × 1 × 1</li>
  <li>Chato 2 × 2 × 1</li>
  <li>Opa 2 × 2 × 2</li>
</ul>

<br>


<p>
Finally the last piece is the Cabeza. This piece moves by sliding to a neighbouring square, including its four diagonal squares.
(Similar to the king in chess). This piece can slide once or twice per turn. If a diagonal slide motion is blocked by the edge of a piece,
it can pass through. But if a diagonal slide requires cutting through the edges of two pieces, then it cannot pass through.

Null moves aren't allowd for any piece. Moves that result in a piece landing on a square occuped by another piece of either player are no allowd. Except for a block piece landing on the opponent's Cabeza piece (see Winning)

The initial starting position is as follows:
